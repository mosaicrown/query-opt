### Attributes

The current version of the cost optimizer works at attribute grained level. It means that the data model is set to relational, even for UDFs. 

An attribute stores information about its actual dimension, state (dimension and state change after a wrapping technique has been applied to it) and the original size, or rather the schema level one.
