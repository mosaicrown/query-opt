### Profilers

Profilers are what enables the comparison between relational operations and user defined functions. Based on the information specified by the user, profilers allows to:
* calculate the number of CPU operations required from the input tuples number;
* calculate the number IO operations required from the input tuples number.

As specified in ```Metrics```, these parameters allow to build simple time estimates.
